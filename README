The IPCalc PHP Extension is a port of the perl script of the same name.

See the README file in that package for installation instructions. Once
it is installed you can compile the IPCalc PHP Extension. You'll need
to make sure you have the PHP development packages installed first
(if you have 'phpize' command you’re all set). You'll also probably
want the PHP command line interface installed as well (usually named
php-cli). After extracting the IPCalc PHP tarball, just run:

phpize
./configure
make
make install

You then need to make PHP aware of the new extension by adding the
following line to your php.ini:

extension="ipcalc.so"

You can then test if the modlue is configure correctly with the
PHP cli:

php -r 'print_r(ipcalc("192.168.1.1", 24));'
